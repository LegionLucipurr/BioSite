                    Isaiah Aguilar is a College Graduate Student from the University of Arizona where he got his
                    Criminal Justice Degree. Currently, Isaiah works as a 911 dispatcher for his local police, where
                    he patiently waits for his time to join the police academy and serve as a Police Officer. Although
                    Isaiah currently waits for admission into the police academy, he still dedicates a lot of his time to
                    staying fit and educated, because serving his community is his highest priority.
                    When Isaiah is not serving his community, he dedicates his time to his family and his hobby, 3D
                    printing. This hobby allows him to channel his art skills and apply them to high-quality pop
                    cultural costumes and props. Although the result of some of these 3D builds can be quite
                    rewarding, Isaiah states that this hobby can be extremely frustrating at times. He states: “There’s
                    nothing worse than having to start a print all over again because something went wrong. Printing
                    alone can take an extremely long time. Not to mention filament can become expensive. By now I
                    think I’ve spent more on filament than I have on my actual 3D printer. But in the end, the hobby
                    is still worth it when you got these insanely cool costumes and props built.” Isaiah has built
                    realistic costumes and props mostly influenced by his love of Star Wars and Marvel.
                    Isaiah claims that if anyone is interested in pursuing a career as a police officer or taking up the
                    hobby of 3D printing, “The effort put into the journey is most defiantly worth it.”
