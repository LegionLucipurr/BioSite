            <h2>3D Printing</h2>
            <p>
                "When I attended the University of Arizona I was fortunate that the campus had a 3D printer
                available for students to use. This is when I discovered the capabilities of a 3D printer and what I
                could build with one. Shortly after this discovery, I did extensive research on what 3D printer
                was the best buy for my budget. After purchasing my own 3D printer, I dedicated a lot of my
                time to learning how to efficiently use my printer. This was extremely challenging to learn at
                first, but eventually, I got the hang of it. My first build was a Batman Baterang from a file I
                found on Etsy. This was an exciting build and was cheap enough to work with. These small
                Baterangs helped me learn efficient painting techniques, what paint to use, what tools I should
                use and so much more. After I improved my skill I then began to work on larger projects. Some
                of these projects you can see in the images below (Clone Trooper Helmet, Black Panther Helmet,
                Commander Cody Helmet, etc.). Because I had a small 3D printer I couldn’t print these projects
                at one time. I was required to print them separately and put them together at the end. This isn’t as
                easy as it sounds, I failed multiple times before getting the results you see now. Eventually, I
                ended up buying a larger printer. This made everything so much faster, and so much easier. I
                now have two 3D printers, one for smaller projects, and the other for larger projects. It’s now
                been 3 years since I discovered how awesome 3D printing has been as a hobby. If this is
                something you wish to learn. Don’t wait! Start learning now. Go out and buy the cheapest 3D
                printer you can find and start with small projects first. You won’t regret it"
